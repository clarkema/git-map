git-map
=======

`git-map` helps you keep on top of large numbers of `git` repositories
by providing means to:

1. get a simple overview of the status of your repositories compared
   to their remotes; and
2. execute `git` subcommands on each of the repositories in turn.

A common problem when dealing with large numbers of repositories is
ensuring that everything is synchronized and all your changes and
branches have been pushed somewhere.

To check you are up-to-date:

1. Get the latest information from all your remotes: `git-map fetch`
2. Run `git-map` for a summary of each repository.

Installation
------------

Copy or symlink `bin/git-map` into your path.  Optionally add an alias
to `$HOME/.gitconfig` so you can call it as `git map`:

    [alias]
    map = ! git-map

`git-map --help` for more details.
